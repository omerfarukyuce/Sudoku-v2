# Sudoku-v2
This project is a Sudoku game written in Python using the Pygame library.

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement game played on a 9x9 grid. The grid is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective of the game is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating. The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled, and the player must fill in the remaining cells to complete the game.

You can learn the solution by pressing the s key on the keyboard.
